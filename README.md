# Gentle Hands-Free Interval Timer
 
Set a timer, start some music, begin a task of your choice.

When the timer finishes, it will quietly crossfade into nature sounds of your choice. Correct your posture, close your eyes, take a couple of deep breaths; some seconds later your music will fade back in and you can return to your task.

Operates identically without music playing. An unobtrusive audio cue to re-center yourself. Repeats as many times as you like, or until you power it down.
