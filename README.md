# Gentle Hands-Free Interval Timer
 
Set a timer, start some music, begin a task.

When the timer finishes, your audio will quietly crossfade into nature sounds. Correct your posture, close your eyes, take a couple of deep breaths; a handful of seconds later, your music will fade back in and you can resume work.

If you don't have music playing, it still operates as an unobtrusive audio cue to re-center yourself. Repeats as many times as you like, or until you power it down.
